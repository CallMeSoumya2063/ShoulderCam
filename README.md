# ShoulderCam (Legacy)
Enhance your 3rd person view with a Shoulder-view Camera with this addon for Minecraft Bedrock Edition.

Legacy version for Minecraft versions 1.20.0 to 1.21.2.

## Usage:
Import the addon into Minecraft and activate it in a world. Make sure to turn on the following *experimental toggles*:
- **Holiday Creator Features** : For 1.20.0 to 1.21.2
- **Experimental Cameras** : For 1.20.0 to 1.20.30, unnecessary in above versions
To activate the camera view, take the "ShoulderCam Activator" item from Equipment tab in creative inventory and right click (or long press on screen for touch controls) while holding the item.
To deactivate the camera view once it's activated, right click (or long press on screen for touch controls) while holding the "Reset Camera" item.

### Known issues & fixes:
1. Camera perspective may get stuck in a position without following the player if activator and reset items are repeatedly used very quickly. **Please don't spam using the items**. If camera is already stuck then try to activate, wait one or two second, then reset.
2. Can't use F5 to change perspective when camera is active. This is a limitation due to the implementation of camera command in the base game. Reset your camera to change perspective normally.
3. Camera passes through blocks, allowing players to x-ray. There's no fix implemented for this, and not planned for any future updates.
4. Activator and Reset items are unobtainable in survival mode without cheats due to the above mentioned issue. There's no fix implemented for this, and not planned for any future updates.

## Future updates:
This legacy version will not be updated because "Holiday Creator Features" experimental toggle is removed from latest versions.
